hi :) This is a personal test for (1) me introducing vibe coding into my daily work, and (2) testing
how LLMs can support my learning, especially when it comes to learning entirely new programming
languages. 

### Just some thoughts so far
1. So far, this project has been hitting it's been defining itself as a super fun peak weekend activity,
and I've been enjoying it immensely. 
2. I'm finding that the LLMs can produce absolute *hot* garbage when actively needing to code against
a specified task with enough written requirements. I'd wager that creating an interated loop of
requirements and specifications with the LLM *first* then specifiying enough of the task in relation
to the requirements would get me much further on the first initial prompt.
